Given the relative inactivity from Onion maintainers, I've taken on a soft fork of the repo to try and keep the ball rolling in terms of quality-of-life changes.

## What this repo is
1. An effort to keep Onion up-to-date with the latest RetroArch and core versions possible.
    - Meaning while this may have the latest RetroArch, we may not have the latest cores for some platforms because of issues.
2. An effort to resolve the more pressing issues in Onion.
    - Meaning the goal is not to fix every bug that Onion has, but ones that are the most annoying or most noticed in normal use.
3. Something to potentially use until Onion has more stable maintenance again.

## What this repo is not
1. The living continuation of the Onion OS project.
    - My goal is not to replace Onion.
    - Once the normal repo is actively maintained again and there is relative parity with the QoL changes here, this ideally stops being maintained.
    - I am not opposed to a hard fork of the project if inactivity persists for an unreasonable amount of time.
2. Stable and well-tested.
    - So far, I am the only known user of the releases here. As such, I can't necessarily test everything for reliability in an efficient amount of time.
    - While the changes here should not have any side-effects of removing files, damaging filesystems, etc., there is no guarantee on stability and reliability.
    - Use at your own risk, keep backups.

## How you can contribute (if you feel like it)
1. Consider making PRs for bugfixes (from the main Onion repo) both in the original project *and* here.
2. Testing various cores for stability and functionality.
   - Anything from game crashing (or not) to whether RetroAchievements considers the core unsupported.
3. Helping keep RetroArch up-to-date in [RetroArch-patch](https://github.com/RdrSeraphim/RetroArch-patch).
